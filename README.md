# Prout Script

## Description

This repository contains the "Prout" script, created by RylexOff. It's a playful prank script designed to add some humor to your interactions. When executed on a Windows 10 or 11 system, it performs actions to increase the volume to the maximum and open a specific webpage.


This script can be used as-is to add a touch of humor. The chosen video is a humorous version of the fart scene from Shrek, as we appreciate quirky humor. That's why it's called the "prout-script".

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Windows 10, 11

### Execution

1. Plug in your bash bunny.
2. Modify the code to specify your preferred browser and video link.
3. The script will automatically execute, raising the volume to the maximum and opening the specified webpage or video.
